# Ascend
A challenging hypercasual game in the vein of Flappy Bird where players try to climb as far as they can get with the given hard-to-master movement kit.  

## Context:
In a tradition that only handful of people choose to make their lives revolve around, every year a few able-bodied try to ascend - physically, to near the tree, spiritually, according to the tradition, to everywhere.
